JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language. A programming language can be called object-oriented if it provides four basic capabilities to developers −
<ul>
<li>Encapsulation − the capability to store related information, whether data or methods, together in an object.</li>

<li>Aggregation − the capability to store one object inside another object.</li>

<li>Inheritance − the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number of classes) for some of its properties and methods.</li>

<li>Polymorphism − the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of different ways</li>
